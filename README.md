## planetrover

Navigation tool for an interplanetary rover

#### Further improvements

1. Allow commands specify a number of instructions repeat e.g (command "F 5" would move the rover forward 5 spaces). This could greatly reduce the number of commands needed.
2. Similarly, it might be useful to have a command "FF" or "BB", which would instruct the rover to continue forward/backward until an obstacle is met.
3. Saving the current state to a file after every n movements could help with power issues. We could also save the state of the planet that the rover knows i.e. all of the obstacles it has encountered thus far.
